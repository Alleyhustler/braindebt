  <h2>Marine Examination Notes</h2>

  Content of this section is divided into different sections covering the different courses. Click the headings to view the specific curriculums. Links that lead offsite are colored <a>green</a>, links leading to other parts of the site are colored <a class="cite">red</a>. These are ultimately just my nautical science study notes compiled in one place. I am learning....<br><br>
  <details>
   <summary>more about this page + disclaimer</summary>
   I am partially self-studying to be a licensed mariner ('coming up the hawse') in Canada, following the requirements set out by Transport Canada in the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2007-115/FullText.html">Marine Personnel Regulations</a> and the exam syllabus published in publication <a href="../bookshelf/TP-2293E-EXAMINATION-CERTIFICATION-SEAFARERS.pdf" title="2024/10/19">TP2293-E</a>, the Examination of Seafarers. The marine industry is really broad and a wide scope of labour falls under the profession of seafaring; which is to say, I ultimately know nothing in the greater scheme of global marine work. I don't operate outside of near coastal waters and probably never will. The intention of this page is just to serve as an archive for my notes leading up to my eventual 'final exam'.  I am sharing my notes publically because I have great interest in the archival and sharing of information and I was particularily inspired by <a href="http://thenauticalsite.in/NauticalNotes.html">the nautical site</a>. I want to create a sort of encyclopedia of modern watchkeeping-related information for myself. <br>
   If you find any of this page difficult to read due to the design, please use the inspect element to disable parts of the css. And lastly if there are any inconsistencies or corrections are necessary (it is hard for me to proofread everything myself) then please reach out to me at greatbigsea446@gmail.com and I will make amendments as required. As well, if you are more qualified than I am or have taken any of these examinations recently, please reach out to me with any additions or exam questions so that I can improve my information database!
  </details><br>
  
  For examinations and courses I have fully completed and passed, I rate how difficult the content was to study out of 5, 1 being easy and 5 being insufferable.

   <h2>General Information</h2>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div>Becoming familiar with the marine personnel regulations and TP2293-E will make life easier, because all of the legal information relating to examinations is contained in those texts. All information related to applying for exams can be found in chapter 2 of TP2293E, Applicants for examinations may find that they are required to submit a minimum amount of sea-service before an application is even issued (enforcement stemming from TP2293E 2.4.). The passing grade for almost all examinations is 70% (TP2293 4.3) and the length is generally 3 hours, but each examination syllabus will state the given length of time for the exam. </div>

  <div id="chartwork">
   <h2>Chartwork</h2>
   <h3><a class="cite" href="cp2.html">Chartwork and Pilotage 2</a> (partial)</h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div>Chartwork and pilotage level 2 is the highest level of chartwork certification available and is defined in page 167 of TP2293E. The syllabus covers definitions of earth's geometry, ability to plot courses on a chart accounting for wind and tide, practical position fixing, tidal calculations, and ability to use publications for passage planning. The most basic equipment needed for chartwork are a parallel ruler (or 2 large protractor triangles) and a navigation divider. </div>
    <div>overall difficulty: 3/5<br>
    focus on: taking the time to learn chartwork properly without rushing work, light mathematics review</div>
   </div>

  <div id="meteorology"><h2>Meteorology</h2>
   <a href="met2.html" class="cite"><h3>Meteorology 2</h3></a>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div>Meteorology level 2 is the highest level of meteorology certification available. Meterology level 2 can be challenged without holding any prior level of meteorology certification. The syllabus for MET2 is laid out on page 57 of TP2293E, and the syllabus for MET1 is on page 139.</div>
    <div>overall difficulty: 3/5<br>
    focus on: a broad range of content is covered, so use the sample exams to narrow down the content you need to focus on understanding.</div>
   </div>
  </div><!-- end of meteorology-->
  
  <div id="navsafety">
   <h2>Navigation Safety</h2>
   <h3><b><a class="cite" href="colregs.html">Navigation Safety 1</a></b></h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div>The navigation safety level 1 syllabus is laid out on page 171 of TP2293E, and covers the content of the collision regulations, principles of the STCW code, and recommendations from the international conference on training and certification of seafarers  1978 (or from any colregs textbook including these welcome additions.</div>
    <div>overall difficulty: 4/5<br>
    focus on: reading the rules carefully and creating a system early on for note taking or memorization</div>

   <h2>Communications</h2>
   <h3><a href="comms.html" class="cite">Communications 1/2</a></h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div>Communications level 1 and 2 are in the process of being merged into one curriculum, but in TP2293E (page 47/8) are still split into 2 seperate small syllabuses. The content is use and recognition of international code flags, and other internationally recognized systems for communication in distress. Examination is partially open book. </div>
    <div>overall difficulty: 1/5<br>
    focus on: memorize flags and some associated morse, familiarize with publications beforehand. TP2293E says the morse portion is to be tested during oral exams.</div>
   </div>

   <h2>Ship Knowledge and Management</h2>
   <h3><a href="gsk.html" class="cite">General Ship Knowledge 3</a></h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div>The syllabus for GSK level 3 is on page 173 of TP2293E. The content covered is largely publication based and the examination is open-book, allowing access to 22+ international and canadian publications.</div>
    <div>overall difficulty: 2/5<br>
    focus on: familiarity with publications and the differences between domestic and international regulations. know which publications to look in for answers as this is an open book examination.</div>

  <div id="eps">
   <h2>Electronic Positioning Systems</h2>
   <h3><a href="eps.html" class="cite">SEN-EPS</a></h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div>EPS is a prerequisite for SEN-O or SEN-1, as part of the simulation training portion. EPS, like SEN, is issued by a training institute and is defined in a seperate publication than other courses,  <a href="../bookshelf/tp4958e.pdf">TP4958</a>. This course is about the equipment used onboard for navigation and focuses on how it works, and the margins of error in all shipboard equipment and systems. </div>
   <div>overall difficulty: 2/5<br>
    focus on: memorizing definitions. try to line the course up with SEN-O or another simulator course following afterwards, as sometimes it can take a long time to get into simulator courses in particular.</div>
   </div>
    </div><!-- end eps-->
