  <h2>Step into the Wheelhouse...</h2>
  Welcome to my wheelhouse, the part of my site specially dedicated to marine transportation. Ships are my special interest and I love to learn anything and everything about them... so the purpose of this page is to be a space where I can dump any marine-related information I collect, including much of my own study notes and any career-related discussions. You will also find my personally curated collection of marine textbooks.
 <br><br>I want to establish early that this page is only dedicated to the commercial and non-military side of the marine industry. Generously speaking, I do not care about the military at all, so I prefer to stay as far away from navy business as possible. I also want to call attention to the fact that I am a super junior mariner so my experience with the industry is very shallow. I am still learning...
