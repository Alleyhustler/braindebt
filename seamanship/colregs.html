   <h2>Navigation Safety</h2>
   <h3>Collision Regulations (with Canadian Modifications)</h3>
   <h3>Forenotes</h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div><b>Resources</b>: the collision regulations are pretty easy to look up examples of. It is important to note that most examples of the collision regulations will be referring to their international version, and therefore it is important to know whether local modifications (ie. canadian modifications) exist. I have multiple books about the collision regulations in my <a href="harbourlibrary.html">library</a>. I have most widely used and cited Cockroft's 'Collision Avoidance Rules', but have also found Dokmar's 'Colregs Guide' and MTB's 'Seamans's Guide to the Rules of the Road' to be helpful to me, despite none of these publications including the canadian modifications. Other helpful study aids have been phone apps for display of lights and demonstrations of sound signals (I prefer the ones made by madeof.blue for android phones) and <a href="https://captaindamley.net/e-modules/collision-regulations/">captaindamley</a> also has a great colregs elearning module with notes. There are great videos on youtube for people who learn the best by watching videos. Canadian mariners will find value in specifically looking for examples of the COLREGS applied to the great lakes, which will usually include much of the canadian modifications. </div>
    <div><b>Considerations:</b> the language used within the colregs is extremely technical and the wording of rules should be carefully noted, particularily the differences between words like 'shall' 'may' and 'must'. 'Shall' will always mean that an action <i>must</i> be taken, wheras 'may' indicates that it is compulsory. Vessel size is also very particular and there is a crucial difference between 'greater than __/less than __' and 'of __ or more/ of __ or less'. An example of this would be a vessel less than 20 meters, which references a vessel from 0 m-to 19.9999 meters- any value that is under 20 meters; as opposed to 20 meters or less, which would include vessels 0 meters - 20 meters. It seems quite straightforward, but it is extremely important to have a solid understanding of the wording used in the regulations because it is crucial in interpretation of the rules.</div>
   </div>
   <h3>Part A- General</h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    
    <div><b>(1) Application</b>: 
     <ul>
      <li>These Rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels.</li>
      <li>Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of special rules made by an appropriate authority for roadsteads, harbours, rivers, lakes or inland waterways connected with the high seas and navigable by sea-going vessels if such special rules conform as closely as possible to these Rules.</li>
      <li>Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the government of any state with respect to additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or with respect to additional station or signal lights or shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape or signal authorized elsewhere under these Rules.</li>
      <li>Traffic separation schemes may be adopted by the Organization for the purpose of these Rules.</li>
      <li>Where the Government concerned determines that a vessel of special construction or purpose cannot comply fully with the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, the vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances as the Government determines to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules in respect of that vessel.</li>
      Canadian modifcations exist as follows...
      <li>Any determination referred to in paragraph (e) in respect of a Canadian vessel or Canadian pleasure craft shall be made by the Minister.</li>
      <li>Each determination referred to in paragraph (e) shall be evaluated to ensure that there will be no reduction in safety taking into account such factors as the following:<br>
      i. in the case of lights,<br>
      A) any impairment of the visibility or distinctive character of the lights,<br>
      B) glare or back-scatter in the navigation or working areas,<br>
      C) vulnerability of the lights to damage, or<br>
      D) difficult or dangerous access to the lights for maintenance purposes, and<br>
      ii. in the case of sound-signalling appliances,<br>
      A) any impairment of audibility or other characteristics of the sound-signalling appliances,<br>
      B) excessive sound pressure levels at listening posts or in navigation or working areas,<br>
      C) vulnerability of the sound-signalling appliances to damage, or<br>
      D) difficult or dangerous access to the sound-signalling appliances for maintenance purposes.</li>
     </ul>
     The general rule of thumb is that the colregs apply to all bodies of water which are connected to the ocean via navigable waters (ie. the great lakes being connected to the atlantic via the st. lawrence seaway). 'Special rules' mentioned could include local adaptations such as a speed limit imposed upon a harbour. Part 1c states that vessels which are required to display certain lights and shapes as a result of special rules take due care that these lights and shapes are clearly distinguishable and cannot be mistaken for other combinations of lights and shapes.</div>
    
    <div><b>(2) Responsibility</b>: rule 2 of the collision regulations is extremely important and at very least the <i>intent</i> of the rules shall be memorized by all mariners. It is as follows...
     <ul>
      <li><i>"Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew therof, from the consequeneces of any neglect to comply with these rules or the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case."</i></li>
      <li><i>"In construing and complying with these rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances, including the limitations of the vessels involved, which may make a departure from the rules necessary to avoid immediate danger."</i></li>
     </ul>
    'A Guide to the Collision Avoidance Rules' by Cockroft breaks this rule down into far more palatable sections. The spirit of the rule has two major components to it; that it is the responsibility of all crew to safely maneuver the vessel; and that if necessary to avoid <i>immediate danger</i> a vessel may make a departure from the rules to avoid collision. It is not justifiable to depart from the rules simply because risk of collision exists with a vessel at some point in the future; the collision regulations may only be disobeyed in the event there is immediate danger and risk of collision. An example of 'precautions required by good seamanship' is the relationship between a ship underway and a ship at anchor; the ship underway is expected to avoid the ship at anchor because the other vessel does not have much maneuverability- but the ship at anchor cannot anchor too close to other boats or neglect to display the symbols which show other vessels that she is a ship at anchor. 
    </div><!--rule 2-->
    <div><b>(3) General Definitions</b>: 
     <ul>For the purpose of these Rules, except where the context otherwise requires:
      <li>The word “vessel” includes every description of water craft, including non-displacement craft, WIG craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.</li>
      <li>The term power-driven vessel means any vessel propelled by machinery.</li>
      <li>The term sailing vessel means any vessel under sail provided that propelling machinery, if fitted, is not being used.</li>
      <li>The term vessel engaged in fishing means any vessel fishing with nets, lines, trawls or other fishing apparatus which restrict manoeuvrability, but does not include a vessel fishing with trolling lines or other fishing apparatus which do not restrict manoeuvrability.</li>
      <li>The word “seaplane” includes any aircraft designed to manoeuvre on the water.</li>
      <li>The term vessel not under command means a vessel which through some exceptional circumstance is unable to manoeuvre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel.</li>
      <li>The term vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre means a vessel which from the nature of her work is restricted in her ability to manoeuvre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel.<br>
      The term “vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre” shall include but not be limited to: <br>
      i. a vessel engaged in laying, servicing or picking up a navigation mark, submarine cable or pipeline,<br>
      ii. a vessel engaged in dredging, surveying or underwater operations,<br>
      iii. a vessel engaged in replenishment or transferring persons, provisions or cargo while underway,<br>
      iv. a vessel engaged in the launching or recovery of aircraft,<br>
      v. a vessel engaged in mineclearance operations,<br>
      vi. a vessel engaged in a towing operation such as severely restricts the towing vessel and her tow in their ability to deviate from their course.</li>
      <li>The term vessel constrained by her draught means a power-driven vessel that, because of the vessel’s draught in relation to the available depth and width of navigable water, is severely restricted in the vessel’s ability to deviate from the course the vessel is following.</li>
      <li>The word underway means that a vessel is not at anchor, or made fast to the shore, or aground.</li>
      <li>The words length and breadth of a vessel mean her length overall and greatest breadth.</li>
      <li>Vessels shall be deemed to be in sight of one another only when one can be observed visually from the other.</li>
      <li>The term restricted visibility means any condition in which visibility is restricted by fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms, sandstorms or any other similar causes.</li>
      <li>The term Wing-in-Ground (WIG) craft means a multimodal craft which, in its main operational mode, flies in close proximity to the surface by utilizing surface-effect action.</li>
      canadian modifications exist as follows...
      <li>For the purposes of these Rules, the definition of the word “vessel” in paragraph (a) does not apply.</li>
     </ul>
     Before getting into the 'rules' section of the Canadian Colregs, there is a similar section called 'interpretation' which defines each particular type of special vessel or equipment referred to in the publications; rule 3 presents these terms plainly and as they are to be defined in reference to the regulations. There are multiple 'definitions' sections to the colregs, and each is relevant to the rules associated with the <i>section</i> it is contained within. The most notable definitions in this part are in regard to the classification of vessels (RAM/NUC/fishing/sailing), of their status (underway), and of conditions affecting visibility (restricted visibility, when vessels are considered in sight of each other). These definitions are extremely important to the interpretation of the collision regulations.
    </div><!--rule 3-->
    
   </div>
   
   <h3>Part B- Steering and Sailing Rules</h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    <h3>Section I - Conduct of Vessels in Any Condition of Visibility</h3>
    <div><b>(4) Application</b>: another application rule. This rule defines that all content follows applies in all conditions of visibility (including restricted visibility). In essence, this means that rules 1-10 apply all the time irregardless of visibility (which is relevant later on) </div>
    <div><b>(5) Lookout</b>: 
     <ul>"Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper lookout via sight and hearing, as well as all other available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and condition, so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of risk of collision."</ul>
     Part of maintaining a good lookout is walking around the wheelhouse (or vessel itself) in order to have visibility of blind spots (such as checking the aft quarters from the bridge wings periodically). Depending on the <i>prevailing circumstances and conditions</i> the need for a lookout may be lessened or heightened; irregardless a lookout must be posted at all times. The radar is a tool which may help supplement navigation and lookout duties (re: 'all available means') but which cannot justify the absence of a dediated lookout.<br>
     Also of note is that this definition tends to come up frequently during the general seamanship oral examinations. Lookout is an extremely important rule as many times in the past poor lookout and watchkeeping have lead to collisions and have thus set a precedent in the court of law. As the navigator and as the OOW it is important to keep a lookout to the best of your ability even solely to cover your own hide in the event that any collision does occur and the finger is pointed your way (it is very easy to nail OOW on poor lookout in the courts). Even at anchor it is necesary to keep a lookout in the bridge <i>so as to make a full appraisal of the situation</i>; there are many reasons for this, but what stands out to me is that the person in the bridge acting as lookout may want to stand by in the event that the anchor drags (which therefore would classify the vessel as 'underway' and require additional rules which apply to vessels underway). Cockroft's <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/c9ttwq.pdf" target="_blank">'collision avoidance rules'</a> has a really great chapter about duties of the lookout, and so does Dokmar's <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/bht7sl.pdf" target="_blank">'colregs guide'</a>.
    </div>
    <div><b>(6) Safe Speed</b>: 
     <ul>Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective
action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing
circumstances and conditions. In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account...</ul>
     <ul>All vessels:
      <li>the state of visibility, (clear or restricted)</li>
      <li>the traffic density including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels,</li>
      <li>the maneoeuverability of the vessel with special refrence to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions,</li>
      <li>at night the presence of background light such as from shore lights or from back scatter of her own lights,</li>
      <li>the state of the wind, sea, and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards,</li>
      <li>the draught in relation to the available depth of water,</li>
     </ul>
     <ul>Additionally, in vessels with operational radar
      <li>the characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment,</li>
      <li>any constraints imposed by the radar range scale in use,</li>
      <li>the effect on radar detection of the sea state, weather and other sources of interference,</li>
      <li>the possibilty that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may not be detected by radar at an adequate range</li>
      <li>the number, location and movement of vessels detected by radar,</li>
      <li>the more exact assessment of the visibility what may be possible when radar is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the vicinity.</li>
     </ul>
     Rule 6 can easily be remembered as having 6 considerations, and then 6 more considerations if you have access to radar. The key point to 'safe speed' is that it is no particular number set in stone and it, obviously, changes depending on the circumstances at hand. For example, a vessel in restricted visibility is expected to reduce her speed greatly in consideration that she cannot see other vessels around and may need to decrease  her stopping distance by reducing her speed. Running too slowly can also be a hazard; a vessel which is stopped or moving very slowly has extremely poor maneuverability and may not be able to take appropriate avoiding action in ample time as a result of this. In vessels with radar, the additional rules exist to prevent reckless behavior as a result of overreliance on the equipment, and in consideration of limitations that radar technology inherently has. This rule has Canadian modifications in regards to conduct around grounded/wrecked, dredge or towing vessels. If a vessel is unsure whether their speed and wake may have an adverse effect on nearby working vessels, she shall proceed cautiously and at the minimum speed which allows her to keep on course (also known as 'reducing to her minimum steerageway').
    </div>
    <div><b>(7) Risk of Collision</b>: 
     <ul>
      <li>Every vessel shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision exists. If there is any doubt such risk shall be deemed to exist.</li>
      <li>Proper use shall be made of radar equipment if fitted and operational, including long-range scanning to obtain early warning of risk of collision and radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects.</li>
      <li><i>Assumptions shall not be made on the basis of scanty information, especially scanty radar information.</i></li>
      <li>In determining if risk of collision exists, the following consideratios shall be among those taken into account...<br>
       i. such risk shall be deemed to exist if the compass bearing of an approaching vessel does not appreciably change,<br>
       ii. such risk may sometimes exist even when an appreciable bearing change is evident, particularly when approaching a very large vessel or a tow or when approaching a vessel at close range
      </li>
     </ul>
     'All available means' encompasses radar and other bridge equipment (such as AIS, radiocommunications, etc) which can be used to help determine risk of collision with another vessel. Radar and ARPA are fantastic tools for long range collision avoidance if they are used with full consideration of their limitations and faults (such as multiple close radar targets merging together into one target on the screen). An easy way to determine if risk of collision exists with a target sighted visually is to align it with a point of reference on your own vessel (ie. a window wiper blade) and observe it for a few minutes; if it remains in alignment (remaining at a constant bearing) then risk of collision exists. 7d.ii also notes that even if the bearing with a target changes, risk of collision may still exist with targets which are very long or large (<a href="https://youtu.be/guvLxBXeJVk?list=PLhumSvKZ_j2KRLs4dccnPQx47T1PeiwCn&amp;t=196">visual demonstration of this</a>). It is very important to determine if risk of collision exists well in advance to allow time for action to be taken.
    </div>
    <div><b>(8) Action to Avoid Collision</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>Any action to avoid collision shall be taken in accordance with the rules of this part, and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.</li>
      <li>Any alteraton of course and/or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small alterations of course and/or speed should be avoided.</li>
      <li>If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.</li>
      <li>Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be as such to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.</li>
      <li>If necessary to avoid collision ot allow more time to asses the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping or reversing her means of propulsion.</li>
      <li>i. A vessel which, by any of these rules, is required not to impede the passage or safe passage of anohter vessel shall, when required by the circumstances of the case, take early action to allow sufficient searoom for the safe passage of the other vessel.<br>
      ii. A vessel required not to impede the passage or the safe passage of another vessel is not relieved of this latter obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by the rules of this part<br>
      iii. A vessel the passage of which is not to be impeded remains fully obliged to comply with the rules of this Part when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision.</li>
     </ul>
     In this rule, we see much of the reoccuring key phrases and terms such as 'be positive, in able time, and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship' which refers to taking well-planned action in ample time and without hesitation. 8b states that if the circumstances of the case admit any alterations to avoid collision should be large so as to be visually apparent; you want to clearly communicate your actions to the other vessel or vessels in the situation. At night and if the circumstances allow, it is a good practice to alter enough to allow the other vessel to see a different sidelight. 8c states that alteration of course <i>may</i> be the best action to avoid collision, allowing the circumstance in which a reduction or increase of speed is the best course of action. 8f.ii keeps the obligation on the give way vessel to keep out of the way of the stand on vessel until free and clear; even if the position of the vessels changes such that the other vessel appears to become the give way vessel, the original obligation takes priority.
    </div>
    <div id="9"><b>(9) Narrow Channels</b>: 
     <ul>
      <li>a vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or fairway shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel or fairway which lies on her starboard side as is safe and practicable,</li>
      <li>a vessel of less than 20 metres in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway,</li>
      <li>a vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway</li>
      <li>a vessel shall not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such channel or fairway. The latter vessel may use the sound signal prescribed in <a href="#34" class="cite">Rule 34</a>(d) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel,</li>
      <li>i. in a narrow channel or fairway when overtaking can take place only if the vessel to be overtaken has to take action to permit safe passing, the vessel intending to overtake shall indicate her intention by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in <a href="#34" class="cite">Rule 34</a>(c)(i). The vessel to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c)(ii) and take steps to permit safe passing. If in doubt she may sound the signals prescribed in Rule 34(d),<br>
       ii. this Rule does not relieve the overtaking vessel of her obligation under <a href="#13" class="cite">Rule 13</a>,</li>
      <li>a vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall navigate with particular alertness and caution and shall sound the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(e),</li>
      <li>any vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid anchoring in a narrow channel.</li>
      Canadian modifications exist for this rule as follows...
      <li>notwithstanding paragraph (d), in the waters of the Great Lakes Basin, a vessel that can safely navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway shall, if a crossing vessel impedes her passage, use the sound signal prescribed in Rule 34(d) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel.</li>
      <li>notwithstanding paragraph (e), in a narrow channel or fairway in the waters of the Great Lakes Basin, a vessel shall indicate its intention to overtake, or its agreement to being overtaken, as the case may be, by sounding the whistle signals prescribed in <a href="#34" class="cite">Rule 34</a>(j).</li>
      <li>in the Canadian waters of a narrow channel or fairway a barge or an inconspicuous, partly submerged vessel or object shall not be navigated, moored or anchored so as to impede the safe passage of any other vessel or object using those waters.</li>
      <li>notwithstanding paragraph (a) and <a href="#14" class="cite">Rule 14</a>(a), in the Canadian waters of a narrow channel or fairway where there is a current or tidal stream and two power-driven vessels are meeting each other from opposite directions so as to involve risk of collision,<br>
      i. the vessel proceeding with the current or tidal stream shall be the stand-on vessel and shall propose the place of passage and shall indicate the side on which she intends to pass by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in <a href="#34" class="cite">Rule 34</a>(a) or (g),<br>
      ii. the vessel proceeding against the current or tidal stream shall keep out of the way of the vessel proceeding with the current or tidal stream and shall hold as necessary to permit safe passing,<br>
      iii. the vessel proceeding against the current or tidal stream shall promptly reply to the signal referred to in subparagraph (i) with the same signal, if she is in agreement, and with the sound signal prescribed in <a href="#34" class="cite">Rule 34</a>(d), if she is in doubt.</li>
     </ul> 
     rule 9 is overall rather straightforward in summary despite its length; vessels should keep to their starboard side, largely not impede other vessels or play around in the center of narrow channels, and use their sound signals to communicate with other traffic when rounding a corner or overtaking. Notably, when overtaking in a narrow channel, the vessel intending to overtake must first ask the vessel to be overtaken for permission (using sound signals or radio communications). Small vessels which are less than 20 meters in length shall nor impede the passage of other vessels which can only navigate within a small area; and vessels engaged in fishing must not impede the passage of any other vessels in the area. The order that vessels 'shall not impede' does not make them 'give way vessels' and the two orders are not the same.
    </div>
    <div id="10"><b>(10) Traffic Seperation Schemes</b>: 
     <ul>
      <li>this rule applies to traffic separation schemes adopted by the Organization and does not relieve any vessel of her obligation under any other rule.</li>
      <li>A vessel using a traffic separation scheme shall:<br>
      i. proceed in the appropriate traffic lane in the general direction of traffic flow for that lane,<br>
      ii. so far as practicable keep clear of a traffic separation line or separation zone,<br>
      iii. normally join or leave a traffic lane at the termination of the lane, but when joining or leaving from either side shall do so at as small an angle to the general direction of traffic flow as practicable.</li>
      <li>A vessel shall, so far as practicable, avoid crossing traffic lanes but, if obliged to do so, shall cross on a heading as nearly as practicable at right angles to the general direction of traffic flow.</li>
      <li>i. A vessel shall not use an inshore traffic zone when it can safely use the appropriate traffic lane within the adjacent traffic separation scheme. However, vessels of less than 20 metres in length, sailing vessels and vessels engaged in fishing may use the inshore traffic zone.<br>
      ii. Notwithstanding subparagraph (i), a vessel may use an inshore traffic zone when en route to or from a port, an offshore installation or structure, a pilot station or any other place situated within the inshore traffic zone or to avoid immediate danger.</li>
      <li>A vessel other than a crossing vessel or a vessel joining or leaving a lane shall not normally enter a separation zone or cross a separation line except<br>

      <li>a power-driven vessel of more than 20 metres in length shall use a traffic separation scheme and the associated routing system, if any, by which it can safely proceed to its destination, that are adopted by the Organization as recommendations and that are in force and described in the publication Ships’ Routeing, as amended from time to time.</li>

      A) the nature, location and duration of the operation, and<br>
      B) any necessary cautionary advice concerning the operation.</li>
      <li>a vessel making a transatlantic voyage shall, as far as practicable, avoid crossing the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and Labrador north of 43° north latitude.</li>
     </ul>
     This rule only applies to traffic seperation schemes which are adopted by IMO and vessels using the lanes are not relieved of their responsibilities under any other rule. Traffic seperation schemes function like shipping 'highways' and typically exist to help control and direct the flow of traffic in busy shipping lanes. Like rule 9, rule 10 is also very lengthy and conveys a lot of simple information in a very convoluted way. Just like on an actual highway, a vessel using a traffic seperation scheme shall proceed in the appropriate traffic lane, follow the general flow of traffic for that lane and keep clear of the seperation line or zone. Entering or exiting the traffic lane should be done at the termination of the lane and should be done at as small of an angle to the general traffic flow as possible (think of 'merging' on the highway). If a vessel absolutely must sail across the traffic seperation scheme then this should be done as close to 90 degrees to the general diretion of traffic flow as possible. There are inshore traffic lanes which exist only for small traffic (vessels less than 20 meters, sailing vessels and fishing vessels) and those vessels are directed not to impede the passage of power-driven vessels following the lanes; these zones are also to be avoided by large traffic which is using the traffic seperation scheme. The inshore traffic lane can be thought of like a 'shoulder' or 'bike lane' if compared to a highway, and the inshore lane should only be used by larger traffic if there is an immediate danger that must be avoided. Fishing vessels may fish within a traffic seperation scheme but must not imepede the passage of <i>any vessel</i> which is participating in the traffic seperation scheme. The rest of the content covered in the rule are more sensibilities; be careful navigating around the terminations of a traffic lane, try not to anchor in a lane unless there is an emergency, and if you are not participating in the traffic seperation scheme then you must give the area a wide berth to avoid confusion. <br>
    Canadian modifications also exist for this rule, giving more allowance to fishing vessels and forcing larger ships to use the traffic lanes and appropriate routing for their cargo type unless there are 'compelling reasons' to not do as such (and such reasons must be recorded in the logbook). The last part of the rule is noteworthy to certain vessels as it is very specific.

    <div id="11"><b>(11) Application</b>:
     <ul><i>rules in this section apply to vessels in sight of one another.</i></ul>
     rule 11 is short and outlines the application of the rules within 'section 2'. Because these rules apply only in the situation where one ship is able to visually sight another, there are situations when they do not apply (which are covered later in the regulations). The rules in this section do not apply to vessels which are detected only via radar.

     </div>
     <b>(12) Sailing Vessels</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>when two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other as follows:<br>
       i. when each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other; <br>
       ii. when both have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to <i>windward</i> shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward; <br>
       iii. if a vessel with the wind on the port side sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on the port or the starboard side, she shall keep out of the way of the other. <br>
      </li>
      <li>for the purpose of this rule the windward side shall be deemed to be the side opposite to that on which the mainsail is carried or, in the case of a square rigged vessel, the side opposite to that on which the largest fore-and-aft sail is carried.</li>
     </ul>
     Rules 8 (action to avoid collision), 13 (overtaking), 16 (action by give way vessel), 17a/b/d (action by stand on vessel) also apply when two sailing vessels are approaching on another (so as to involve risk of collision). It is important to note whether a 'sailing vessel' is also be propelled by machinery even if her sail is up, which would then define her as a 'power-driven vessel'. Cockroft's 'collision avoidance rules' states an exception to the rule; if a sailing vessel is approaching another sailing vesel from more than 22.5 degrees abaft the beam is an overtaking vessel and <i>rule 13 overrides/takes precedence over rule 12</i> in this scenario. 12a(i) can be thought of as adhering to the 'general' rules for alteration; the vessel with wind to port will ultimately alter to starboard (as she cannot sail into the wind).
    </div>
    <div id="13">
     <div class="wiki"><img src="../imageuploads/marine/overtaking%20arc%20of%20vis.png" style="object-fit: contain;"><div class="desc">the arc of visibility relevant to overtaking</div></div>
     <b>(13) Overtaking</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>notwithstanding anything contained in the rules of part B, sections I and II, any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken,</li>
      <li>a vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another vessel from a direction more than <i>22.5 degrees abaft her beam</i>, that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel she is overtaking, that at night she would be able to see only the sternlight of that vessel but neither of her sidelights,</li>
      <li>when a vessel is in any doubt as to whether she is overtaking another, she shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly,</li>
      <li>any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these rules or relieve her the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear,</li>
     </ul>
     It is the duty of any overtaking vessel (the one doing the overtaking) to keep out of the way of any vessel that she s overtaking (including sailing vessels, fishing vessels and small vessels). Rule 13 takes precedence over rule 12 (sailing vessels) and rule 18 (responsibilities between vessels), requiring vessels which normally may need to avoid one another to keep out of the way of a vessel being overtaken irregardless of what kind of vessel it is. Prime resonsibility for keeping out of the way is allocated to the overtaking vessel in every case as that vesel must be proceeding at greater speed and is more likely to sight the vessel being overtaken at an early stage. A vessel overtaking another is not necessarily required to avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel but altering course or reducing speed in order to pass astern may be the safest form of avoiding action. A power-driven vessel approaching another power-driven vessel from approximately 22.5 degrees abaft the beam should have no doubt as to whether she is overtaking or crossing as <i>in a crossing situation the side-light can be seen</i>, whereas in an overtaking situation the sidelights should not initially be visible (as mentioned in 13b). Because ships in close proximity to one another exert forces of attraction on one another, particularily when a large vessel overtakes a small vessel and at high speeds, it is important for an overtaking vessel to not come too close to a vessel which is being overtaken. Canadian modifications exist for this rule in regards to overtaking within the waters of the Great Lakes Basin and the different lights which may be displayed in the great lakes.
    </div>
    <div><b>(14) Head on Situation</b>: 
     <ul>
      <li>when two <i>power-driven vessels</i> are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision each shall alter her course to starboard so that each shall pass on the port side of the other,</li>
      <li>such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead and by night she could see the masthead lighs of the other in a line or nearly in a line and/or both sidelights and by day she observes the corresponding aspect of the other vessel,</li>
      <li>when a vessel is in any doubt as to whetehr such a situation exists she shall assume that id does exist and act accordingly</li>
     </ul>
     Rule 14 places equal responsibility for keeping out of the way on each of the two vesels involved and states exactly what action should be taken by each vessel. <i>This rule applies only to power-driven vessels.</i> The wording of the rule makes it clear that it is based off of the direction of the ships head and not the course made good. Even if it seems that it would be reasonable for both vessels to alter to port and pass on the starboard side of one another, it is not recommended to act against the rules as several collisions have occured as a result of this and have set a precedent.
    </div>
    <div><b>(15) Crossing Situation</b>: 
     <ul>when  two <i>power-driven vesels</i> are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vesesl which has the other on <i>her own starboard side</i> shall keep out of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.</ul>
     Like the last, this rule also only applies to power-driven vessels. When crossing in narrow channels and traffic seperation schemes, even if they normally might have priority in a crossing situation, a vessl crossing a narrow channel or traffic lane is required to not impede the safe passage of other vessels which are using these channels or lanes. It should be noted that this rule only applies to vessels which are in sight of one another, so in conditions of restricted visibility the actions to be taken are different. It is important for the give-way vessel to avoid alterations to port in crossing situations as if the give way vessel was to alter to port contrary to the rules, a collision may occur. The stand on vessel has the responsibility to keep their course and speed, allowing the give-way vessel to act- but is not excempt from taking action and must act to avoid collision if the give-way vessel is not acting. Canadian modifications for this rule exist in regards to vessels crossing rivers (in canadian waers a vessel crossing a river shall keep out of the way of a power-driven vessel ascending or descending the river, except on the St Lawrence River seaward of Ile Rouge)
    </div>
    <div><b>(16) Action by Give-way Vessel</b>:
     <ul>every vessel which is directed to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, so far as possible, take early and substantial action to keep well clear</ul>
     The key words in rule 16 are the direction for the give-way vessel to take 'early and substantial action' to keep well clear. Rule 8 quite clearly defines the requirements of both the stand-on and give-way vessels when taking action to avoid collision. Rule 16 applies to vessls which are in sight of one another.
    </div>
    <div><b>(17) Action by Stand-on Vessel</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>i. where one of two vessels is to keep  out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed,<br>
       ii. the latter vessel may however take action to avoid collision by her manoeuvre alone, as soon as it becomes apparent to her tha the vessel required to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action in compliance with these rules, <br>
      </li>
      <li>when, from any cause, the vessel required to keep her course and speed finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give-way vessel alone, she shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision,</li>
      <li>a power-driven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in accordance with subparagraph a(ii) of this rule to avoid collision with another power-driven vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side,</li>
      <li>this rule does not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligation to keep out of the way</li>
     </ul>
     Rule 17 is a little longer than 16, its 'companion' rule.  Most importantly in the rule is the designation that the stand-on vessel must take action itself if it becomes apparent that the give-way vessel is not acting to avoid collision as it should (for some reason or another). A question which is often asked on examinations is in regards to 17b, in which a vessel which finds herself in an imminent collision and must take whatever action she is able to take in order to best avoid collision. Rule 17 permits a stand-on vessel to take action to avoid collision earlier than rule 2 (responsibility) would. It is important, if one finds themself in doubt as to the other vessel's intentions, that they use the sound signal prescribed in rule 34 to communicate and convey their confusion. 17b does not prescribe any particular action which must be taken by a stand-on vessel (17c mentions the avoidance of an alteration to port) and leaves it up to the navigator to 'take such action as will best aid to avoid collision'.  It can be thought of that collision situations have four stages;
     <ul>1. at long range before risk of collision exists, both vessels are free to act<br>
     2. when risk of collision first begins to apply, the give-way vessel is required to take 'early and substantial action' and the stand on vessel must keep her course and speed.<br>
     3. when it becomes apparent that the give0way vessel is not taking action as required, the stand on vessel is then permitted to take avoiding action (after sounding their whistle to express confusion about intent)- but very importantly must not make any alterations to port in the case that there is traffic to the port side.<br>
     4. when collision cannot be avoided by the give-way vessel alone, the stand on vessel shall (must) take any action necessary to avoid a collision

     <b>(18) Responsibilities Between Vessels</b>: 
     <ul>except where rules 9 (narrow channels), 10 (traffic seperation schemes) and 13 (overtaking) otherwise require:
      <li>a power driven vessel underway shall keep out of the way of;<br>
       i. a vessel not under command, <br>
       ii. a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre, <br>
       iii. a vessel engaged in fishing, <br>
       iv. a sailing vessel
      </li>
      <li>a sailing vessel underway shall keep out of the way of;<br>
       i. a vessel not under command, <br>
       ii. a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre, <br>
       iii. a vessel engaged in fishing,
      </li>
      <li>a vessel engaged in fishing when underway shall, so far as possible, keep out of the way of;<br>
       i. a vessel not under command, <br>
       ii. a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre,
      </li>
      <li>i. any vessel other than a vessel not under command or a vessel restricte din her ability to manoeuvre shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid impeding the safe passage of a vessel constrained by her draught, exhibiting the signals in <a href="#28" class="cite">Rule 28</a>, <br>
      ii. a vessel constrained by her draught shall navigate with particular caustion having full regard to her special condition,</li>
      <li>a seaplane on the water shall, in general, keep well clear of all vessels and avoid impeding their navigation. In circumstances, however, where risk of collision exists, she shall complay with the rules of this part.</li>
      <li>i. a WIG craft shall, when taking off, landing and in flight near the surface, keep welll clear of all other vessels and avoid impeding their navigation,<br>
      ii. a WIG craft operating on the water surface shall comply with the rules of this part as a power driven vessel.</li>
     </ul>
     This rule breaks down the different 'classifications' between vessels and establishes, for the most part, who takes 'priority' over other vessels in mindfulness of their overall maneouverability characteristics. It is of note that most vessels are classified as power-driven vessels, and take on these other types depending on the circumstances they find themselves in, or by the work that they perform. For example, a fishing boat may be normally considered as a power-driven vessel, but while actively engaged in fishing takes on the classification of a 'vessel engaged in fishing'. All of these 'states' of vessels are covered and defined in rule 3 (general definitions). A tug which is towing cargo is not considered as anything other than a power-driven vessel unless the nature of her work severely restricts her maneouvrability. It is important for each vessel to display the proper lights and shapes in accordance with her status in order for other vessels to responsibly navigate in and around her.
    </div>
    <h3>Section III - Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility</h3>
    <div><b>(19) Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility</b>: 
     <ul>
      <li>this rule applies to vessels not in sight of one another when navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility,</li>
      <li>every vessel shall proceeed at a safe speed adapted to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility. A power-driven vessel shall have her engines available for immediate maneouvre,</li>
      <li>every vessel shall have due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility when complying with the rules of section I of this part,</li>
      <li>a vessel which detects by radar alone the presence of another vessel shall determine if a close-quarters situation is developing and/or risk of collision exists. If so, she shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible the following shall be avoided:<br>
      i. an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken, <br>
      ii. an alteration of course towards a vessel abeam or abaft the beam,</li>
      <li>except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of her beam the fog signal of another vessel, or which cannot avoid a close-quarters situation with another vessel forward of her beam, shall reduce her speed to the minimum at which she can be kept on her course. She <i>shall if necessary</i> take all her way off and in any event navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over,</li>
     </ul>
     Rule 19 is the only rule which falls under section 3, dealing with vessels which <i> are not in sight of one another</i>. Because vessels are not in sight of one another, rules which are contained within section 2 may not necessarily apply (ie. in the case of targets which are detected only via radar). Rule 19 applies both when in restricted visibility and when <i>near restricted visibility</i>; if a vessel was on the edge of a fog bank but not necessarily in the bank, then rule 19 would still apply. When navigating in or near restricted visibility it is extremely important to sound the fog signal as prescribed in Rule 34 (which we will cover later). Part of 'having due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions' may be enhanced watchkeeping procedures; such as the additional posting of lookouts to watch or listen for the signals of other vessels in the area. 19e poses the scenario where another vessel is detected but the exact position may not be known; therefore it is imperative to reduce speed so as to minimize damage in the event of collision and to hold off on recklessly altering until the position of the other vessel is determined, at which point immediate action can be taken to avoid collision. 19d parts i and ii exist to help establish responsibilities and general cardinals while in restricted visibility, when rules like 14 and 15 do not apply to dictate avoiding action. Restricted visibility has no particular parameters for classification; restricted visibility is considered to exist when visibility is obscured, obviously; the measures and caution which should be had depend on the range of visibility within the fog (which can be determined quite accurately using radar ranging off of known objects or landmarks). 19e comes up often in examinations and has many nuances in the construction of the rule which should be carefully noted; 'she shall if necessary' means that if it is deemed necessary it must done,

   <h3>Part C - Lights and Shapes</h3>
   <div class="info indent">
    <div><b>(20) Application</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>rules of this part shall be complied with in all weathers,</li>
      <li>the rules concerning lights shall be complied with from sunset to sunrise and during such times no other lights shall be exhibited, except such lights as cannot be mistaken for the lights specified in these rules or do not impair their visibility or distinctive character, or interfere with the keeping of a proper look-out,</li>
      <li>the lights prescribed by these rules shall, if carried, also be exhibited from sunrise to sunset in restricted visibility and may be exhibited in all other circumstances when it is deemed necessary,</li>
      <li>the rules concerning shapes shall be complied with by day</li>
      <li>the lights and shapes specified in these rules shall comply with the provisions of annex I to these regulations</li>
     </ul>
     Outlines the application of rules for this section. Even small vessels are expected to comply with the rules concerning lights and shapes in all weather conditions. If any lights are lost or extinguished they must be replaced or repaired as soon as possible. 'No other lights shall be exhibited' is to deter vessels from running with their working lights on at night, which both obscures their navigational lights and also diminishes the nighttime vision of other vessels in the area, though there are specific situations in which it is required for the decks to be illuminated (rule 30c). There is a significance in the use of 
     'underway' as a status which dictates lights must be switched on, as a vessel is to be considered as 'underway' anytime she is not tied to the dock, aground, or anchored (in the event that an anchored vessel begins to drag anchor, she also becomes 'underway').

     <div class="wiki"><img src="../imageuploads/marine/arc%20of%20light%20vis.png"><div class="desc">diagram of light visibility</div></div>
     <b>(21) Definitions</b>: 
     <ul>
      <li>'masthead light' means a white light placed over the fore and aft centerline of the vessel showing an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of <i>225 degrees</i> and so fixed as to show the light from right ahead to 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on either side of the vessel,</li>
      <li>'sidelights' means a green light on the starboard side and a red light on the port side each showing an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 112.5 degrees and so fixed as to show the light from right ahead to 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on its respective side. In a vessel of <i>less than</i> 20 meters in length the sidelights <i>may</i> be combined in one lantern carried on the fore and aft centerline of the vessel,</li>
      <li>'sternlight' means a white light placed as nearly as practicable at the sterm showing an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 135 degrees and so fixed as to show the light 67.5 degrees from right aft on each side of the vessel,</li>
      <li>'towing light' means a yellow light having the same characteristic as the 'sternlight' defined in paragraph (c) of this rule,</li>
      <li>'all-around light' means a light showing an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of 360 degrees,</li>
      <li>'flashing light' means a light flashing at regular intervals at a frequency of 120 flashes or more per minute,</li>
      Additional Canadian Modifications for this rule exist as follows;
      <li>'special flashing light' means a yellow light flashing at regular intervals at a frequency of 50 to 70 flashes per minute, placed as far forward and as nearly as practicable on the fore and aft centerline of a vessel and showing an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of not less than 180 degrees nor more than 225 degrees and so fixed as to show the light from right ahead to abeam and not more than 22.5 degrees abaft the mean on either side of the vessel,</li>
      <li>'blue flashing light' means a blue all-around light flashing at regular intervals at a frequency of 50-70 flashes per minute,</li>
     </ul>
     As for all parts, it is important to know the specific definitions for terminology which is used within the section (as this is what is asked on the examinations). The canadian modifications to this rule are both in reference to lights which flash at a different frequency than the 'flashing lights' in international rules, and while the wording for 'special flashing lights' is very wordy- it boils down to having an arc of visibility which is no greater than that of the masthead light and which is visible over 180 degrees (the forward half of the vessel) at least. When referring to 'an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon' this means that there are no blind sectors whereby the light in question would not be visible.

      - a towing light, 2 miles<br>
      - a white, red, green or yellow all-around light, 2 miles</li>
      <li>in inconspicuous, partly submerged vessels or objects being towed;<br>
      - a white all-around light, 3 miles,</li>
      Canadian modifications exist as follows...
      <li>in vessels exhibiting;<br>
      - a special flashing light, 2 miles<br>
      - a blue flashing light, 2 miles</li>
     </ul>
     Because the canadian modifications for special canadian lights have no lengths associated with their visibility, it can be thought of that a blue flashing light and a special flashing light will always have a visible range of 2 miles. Becasuse of changes to environmental conditions, it may be possible for lights to be seen over a greater distance than specified. Masthead lights are always visible at the greatest range and are the typically always the first lights which are brought into view.

     </ul>
     rule 24 is one of the longest rules in the canadian modifications to the collision regulations, with 13 sections, each containing multiple subsections and referencing other subheadings and previous rules. A vessel which is engaged in towing is also a power-driven vessel, so certain rules pertaining to the vessel itself from part 23 (like the length calling for an additional masthead light) apply here (see 24d). When viewing a vessel being towed from directly astern, it may not be possible to tell whether the tow is greater than 200 meters because the mastlights indicating this are not visible from the 'stern' arc of visibility- only the sternlight and towing light would be visible, in addition to any lights which are displayed on the tow itself. 24h provides that, if towing an object (partially submerged or otherwise) and it is not able to be lit as these rules call for, an effort will be made to light it to indicate its presence at the very least; and 24j further adds onto 24h and gives conditions for barges which are being towed. Within the great lakes basin, the requirements for lights are different and power driven vessels must display two towing lights in a line rather than the sternlight; in practice, this wouldn't look that different from a normal towing light configuration at the stern except that there would now be two yellow lights instead of a white and a yellow light. 24j surfaces often on the NS1 level examinations and should be noted with care.

      <li>a  sailing vessel underway may, in addition to the lights prescribed in paragraph (a) of this Rule, exhibit at or near the top of the mast, where they can best be seen, two all-round lights in a vertical line, the upper being red and the lower green, but these lights shall not be exhibited in conjunction with the combined lantern permitted by paragraph (b) of this Rule,</li>
      <li>i. a sailing vessel of less than 7 metres in length shall, if practicable, exhibit the lights prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Rule, but if she does not, she shall have ready at hand an electric torch or lighted lantern showing a white light which shall be exhibited in sufficient time to prevent collision,<br>
      ii. a vessel under oars may exhibit the lights prescribed in this Rule for sailing vessels, but if she does not, she shall have ready at hand an electric torch or lighted lantern showing a white light which shall be exhibited in sufficient time to prevent collision.</li>
      <li>a vessel proceeding under sail when also being propelled by machinery shall exhibit forward where it can best be seen a conical shape, apex downwards.</li>
      canadian modifications exist as follows....
      <li>notwithstanding paragraph (e), in the Canadian waters of a roadstead, harbour, river, lake or inland waterway, a vessel of less than 12 metres in length proceeding under sail when also being propelled by machinery is not required to exhibit a conical shape, apex downwards, but may do so.</li>
     </ul>
     It is of note that sailing vessels do not have a 'standard' masthead light. When a sailing vessel is exhibiting the conical day shape they are indicating that they have no more privilege than a power driven vessel (even if their sails are out); and at night a sailing vessel being propelled by machinery (even if sails are out) would exhibit the same lights as a power driven vessel. As provided in 25c, a sailing vessel <i>may</i> exhibit two all around lights, the upper red and the lower green- this is optional, and a sailing vessel is only <i>required</i> to display sidelights (which may be combined into one lantern) and a sternlight.

      <li>a vessel when engaged in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trawling">trawling</a>, by which is meant the dragging through the water of a dredge net or other apparatus used as a fishing appliance, shall exhibit;<br>
      i. two all-round lights in a vertical line, the upper being green and the lower white, or a shape consisting of two cones with their apexes together in a vertical line one above the other,<br>
      ii. a masthead light abaft of and higher than the all-round green light; a vessel of less than 50 metres in length shall not be obliged to exhibit such a light but may do so,<br>
      iii. when making way through the water, in addition to the lights prescribed in this paragraph, sidelights and a sternlight.</li>
      <li>a vessel engaged in fishing, other than trawling, shall exhibit:<br>
      i. two all-round lights in a vertical line, the upper being red and the lower white, or a shape consisting of two cones with their apexes together in a vertical line one above the other,<br>
      ii. when there is outlying gear extending more than 150 metres horizontally from the vessel, an all-round white light or a cone apex upwards in the direction of the gear,<br>
      iii. when making way through the water, in addition to the lights prescribed in this paragraph, sidelights and a sternlight.</li>

      <li>a vessel when not engaged in fishing shall not exhibit the lights or shapes prescribed in this Rule, but only those prescribed for a vessel of her length.</li>
     </ul>
     A vessel not engaged in fishing (as in not having their nets or other fishing apparatus out) is a power driven vessel and must display lights as such. Notable in part 26a is that 'whether underway or at anchor' shall (must) exhibit the lights and shapes prescribed in rule 26 as long as they are fishing. The all-around lights prescribed in this rule must be exhibited when fishing, but the side and sternlights must only be used when <i>making way through the water</i>. Regardless of the length of the vessel, there are no additional masthead lights which are prescribed for <i>vessels engaged in fishing</i> (these circumstances change when they stop fishing). A fishing vessel with outlying gear must exhibit an all-around white light or conical dayshape with the apex (point) of the cone upwards in the direction of the fishing gear.

     </ul>
     Vessels which are 'not under command' do not display a mast head light or lights, and only display sidelights when <i>making way through the water</i>. A vessel restricted in her ability to maneouvre is restricted by the nature of her work and must display the appropriate all-around lights to indicate this; and in addition must display sidelights, a sternlight and any masthead lights if <i>making way through the water</i>. Dredging and vessels conducting underwater operations have special signals to indicate their special status to traffic; the side with two diamonds, or that has two green lights indicates the side which is safe to pass (though at great distances, it may be permissable to pass on either side of the vessel). In order to be considered 'not under command' a vessel must be underway; however with vessels 'restricted in their ability to maneouvre' even a vessel at anchor can hold this status. A mine-clearance ship does not have to exhibit the same symbols as other RAM vessels, in order to help differentiate this status and better convey the hazard of coming too close to this type of vessel.

      <li>notwithstanding this Rule, in the Canadian waters of a roadstead, harbour, river, lake or inland waterway, a barge or an inconspicuous, partly submerged vessel or object, when at anchor, is not required to exhibit any light while located within a recognized mooring, storage or booming area that is not an area in or near a narrow channel or fairway or where other vessels normally navigate.</li>
     </ul>
     The anchoring rules are very straightforward and are laid out by vessel size; a vessel greater than 50 meters must exhibit an additional light on the stern when at anchor (the intention of which is to just mark the forward and aft ends of the vessel that may otherwise be obscured by darkness). Vessels of greater than 100 meters in length <i>must</i> illuminate their outer decks (and smaller vessels <i>may</i> also do the same). A vessel aground must exhibit the symbols as if she was at anchor, and in addition to this must also display two all around lights in a vertical line (similarily to if she was NUC, as they may be considered comparable statuses) or three black balls in a vertical line. The canadian modifications direct barge and other towing-related objects to rule 24, where they are covered there. If a barge is anchored within a recogized mooring/storage/boom area it is authorized to <i>not exhibit any lights at all</i> so long as it is not in a narrow channel or fairway, or an area where other vessels normally navigate (this information has notably appeared on NS1 examinations).

   <h3>Part D - Sound and Light Signals</h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div><b>(32) Definitions</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>the word 'whistle' means any sound signalling appliance capable of producing the prescibed blasts and which complies witht he specifications in Annex III to these regulations,</li>
      <li>the term 'short blast' means a blast of about one second's duration,</li>
      <li>the term 'prolonged blast' means a blast of from four to six seconds' duration,</li>
     </ul>
     A short blast is <i>about</i> second long, and a prolonged blast is <i>4-6 seconds</i>; both of these are emulating or are comparable to morse code signal lengths.
    </div>
    <div><b>(33) Equipment for Sound Signals</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>a vessel of 12 metres or more in length shall be provided with a whistle, a vessel of 20 metres or more in length shall be provided with a bell in addition to a whistle, and a vessel of 100 metres or more in length shall, in addition, be provided with a gong, the tone and sound of which cannot be confused with that of the bell. The whistle, bell and gong shall comply with the specification in Annex III to these Regulations. The bell or gong or both may be replaced by other equipment having the same respective sound characteristics, provided that manual sounding of the prescribed signals shall always be possible,</li>
      <li>a vessel of less than 12 metres in length shall not be obliged to carry the sound signalling appliances prescribed in paragraph (a) of this Rule but if she does not, she shall be provided with some other means of making an efficient sound signal,</li>
      Canadian modifications exist as follows...
      <li>notwithstanding paragraph (b), in the Canadian waters of a roadstead, harbour, river, lake or inland waterway, a vessel shall carry the sound signalling appliances prescribed in paragraph (a) for a vessel of 12 metres or more in length, if it is,<br>
      i. less than 12 metres in length,<br>
      ii. ordinarily used for the purpose of pushing or pulling any floating object, and,<br>
      iii. not employed solely in yarding or warping operations.</li>
     </ul>
     The fairly standard vessel sizing makes a return in rule 34 (12m, 20m, and 100m), though the wording should be paid careful attention to as it refers to vessels 100 meters or more (meaning the previous rules effect vessels of 20-99 meters long). A vessel which is less than 12 meters is permitted to use even a simple airhorn for sound signalling.

     <b>(34) Maneouvering and Warning Signals</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>when vessels are <i>in sight of one another</i>, a power-driven vessel underway, when manoeuvring as authorized or required by these rules, shall indicate that manoeuvre by the following signals on her whistle:<br>
      - one short blast to mean “I am altering my course to starboard”,<br>
      - two short blasts to mean “I am altering my course to port”,<br>
      - three short blasts to mean “I am operating astern propulsion”.</li>
      <li>any vessel <i>may</i> supplement the whistle signals prescribed in paragraph (a) of this Rule by light signals, repeated as appropriate, whilst the manoeuvre is being carried out:<br>
      i. these light signals shall have the following significance;<br>
      - one flash to mean “I am altering my course to starboard”,<br>
      - two flashes to mean “I am altering my course to port”,<br>
      - three flashes to mean “I am operating astern propulsion”,<br>
      ii. the duration of each flash shall be about one second, the interval between flashes shall be about one second, and the interval between successive signals shall be not less than 10 seconds,<br>
      iii. the light used for this signal shall, if fitted, be an all-round white light, visible at a minimum range of 5 miles, and shall comply with the provisions of Annex I.</li>
      <li>when in sight of one another in a narrow channel or fairway:<br>
      i. a vessel intending to overtake another shall in compliance with <a href="#9" class="cite">Rule 9</a>(e)(i) indicate her intention by the following signals on her whistle:<br>
      - two prolonged blasts followed by one short blast to mean “I intend to overtake you on your starboard side”,<br>
      - two prolonged blasts followed by two short blasts to mean “I intend to overtake you on your port side”,<br>
      ii. the vessel about to be overtaken when acting in accordance with <a href="#9" class="cite">Rule 9</a>(e)(i) shall indicate her agreement by the following signal on her whistle;<br>
      - one prolonged blast, one short, one prolonged and one short blast, in that order.</li>
      <li>when vessels in sight of one another are approaching each other and from any cause either vessel fails to understand the intentions or actions of the other, or is in doubt whether sufficient action is being taken by the other to avoid collision, the vessel in doubt shall immediately indicate such doubt by giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the whistle. Such signal may be supplemented by a light signal of at least five short and rapid flashes.</li>
      <li>a vessel nearing a bend or an area of a channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall sound one prolonged blast. Such signal shall be answered with a prolonged blast by any approaching vessel that may be within hearing around the bend or behind the intervening obstruction.</li>
      <li>if whistles are fitted on a vessel at a distance apart of more than 100 metres, one whistle only shall be used for giving manoeuvring and warning signals.</li>
      Canadian modifications exist as follows...
      <li>notwithstanding paragraph (a), in the waters of the Great Lakes Basin, when power-driven vessels are in sight of one another and meeting or crossing at a distance within half a mile of each other, each vessel underway, when manoeuvring as authorized or required by these rules<br>
      i. shall indicate that manoeuvre as by the following signals on her whistle;<br>
      - one short blast to mean “I intend to leave you on my port side”,<br>
      - two short blasts to mean “I intend to leave you on my starboard side”, and<br>
      - three short blasts to mean “I am operating astern propulsion”, and<br>
      ii. shall, upon hearing the one or two blast signal, referred to in subparagraph (i), of the other vessel indicate her agreement by sounding the same whistle signal and taking the steps necessary to effect a safe passing. If, however, for any cause, a vessel on hearing a one or two blast signal referred to in subparagraph (i) doubts the safety of the proposed manoeuvre, she shall sound the signal specified in paragraph (d) and each vessel shall take appropriate precautionary action until a safe passing agreement is made.</li>
      <li>notwithstanding paragraph (b), in the waters of the Great Lakes Basin, a vessel may supplement the whistle signals prescribed in paragraph (g) by light signals<br>
      i. that have the following significance:<br>
      - one flash to mean “I intend to leave you on my port side”,<br>
      - two flashes to mean “I intend to leave you on my starboard side”,<br>
      - three flashes to mean “I am operating astern propulsion”, and<br>
      ii. the duration of which shall be about one second for each flash.</li>
      <li>the light used for a signal referred to in paragraph (h), shall, if fitted, be one all-round white or yellow light, visible at a minimum range of two miles, synchronized with the whistle signal referred to in paragraph (g), and shall comply with section 12 of Annex I.</li>
      <li>notwithstanding paragraph (c), in the waters of the Great Lakes Basin, when power-driven vessels are in sight of one another in a narrow channel or fairway,<br>
      i. the vessel intending to overtake another shall, in compliance with <a href="#9" class="cite">Rule 9</a>(i), indicate her intention by the following signals on her whistle:<br>
      - one short blast to mean “I intend to overtake you on your starboard side”,<br>
      - two short blasts to mean “I intend to overtake you on your port side”,<br>
      ii. the vessel about to be overtaken when acting in accordance with <a href="#9" class="cite">Rule 9</a>(i) shall, if in agreement, sound the same signal as given by the other vessel. If in doubt, she shall sound the signal prescribed in paragraph (d)</li>
      <li>In the Canadian waters of a roadstead, harbour, river, lake or inland waterway, a power-driven vessel of 12 metres or more in length that is leaving a dock or berth shall give a signal of one prolonged blast unless<br>
      i. the vessel is a ferry making a scheduled departure from a dock or berth from which more than six daily scheduled departures are made,<br>
      ii. the visibility is not less than 3 miles, and<br>
      iii. the master of the ferry has used all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if the signal is needed for a safe departure and has determined that it is not.</li>
      <li>notwithstanding this Rule and <a href="#9" class="cite">Rule 9</a>, if positive mutual identification of the vessels has been made in the Canadian waters of a roadstead, harbour, river, lake or inland waterway, a vessel may use a bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone instead of the prescribed whistle signals to reach agreement in a meeting, crossing or overtaking situation. If agreement is not reached, then whistle signals shall be exchanged in a timely manner and shall prevail.</li>
     </ul>
     Rule 34a lays out multiple perimeters which vessels must pass in order for the rule to apply; she must be a power-driven vessel, must be underway, and must be in sight of another vessel. Signals prescribed in 34a are 'signals of action' which inform the other vessel of your actions, not just of your intention to act (this distinction is important when compared against the signals of intent prescribed in 9e, or 34g). Light signals <i>may</i> be used to supplement the whistle signals, but this is not required, and a 'gap' of 10 seconds between signals must be allowed. In channels around a bend or where view may be obscured vessels must give one prolonged blast, which nearby vessels must 'echo' back by repeating the same signal if heard. The signal prescribed for agreement is the morse code for 'charlie' (-.-.) from the International Code of Signals (meaning yes/agreement), and the signal for confusion or danger is five short blasts (.....), which does not coincide with any morse signals but is quite universally regarded and recognized as the warning signal. 34g gives <i>different signals</i> than the ones prescribed in 34a, which similarily must pass multiple 'tests' in order to be applicable; vessels must be located within the Great Lakes Basin, in sight of one another, and with a closest point of approach (CPA) within half a mile of one another. The signals prescribed in 34g, like 34a, are signals of <i>intention</i> to act rather than of action. The light signals in 34h, which may supplement (be added onto) the sound signals, have a minimum visibility of 2 miles and may be given with either an all around yellow or all around white light; they must also be synchronized with the whistle sound signals.

     <b>(35) Sound Signals in Restricted Visibility</b>:
     <ul>
      In or near an area of restricted visibility, whether by day or night, the signals prescribed in this Rule shall be used as follows:
      <li>a power-driven vessel making way through the water shall sound at intervals of not more than two minutes one prolonged blast.</li>
      <li>a power-driven vessel underway but stopped and making no way through the water shall sound at intervals of not more than two minutes two prolonged blasts in succession with an interval of about two seconds between them.</li>
      <li>a vessel not under command, a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre, a vessel constrained by her draught, a sailing vessel, a vessel engaged in fishing and a vessel engaged in towing or pushing another vessel shall, instead of the signals prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Rule, sound at intervals of not more than two minutes three blasts in succession, namely one prolonged followed by two short blasts.</li>
      <li>a vessel engaged in fishing, when at anchor, and a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre when carrying out her work at anchor, shall instead of the signals prescribed in paragraph (g) of this Rule sound the signal prescribed in paragraph (c) of this Rule.</li>
      <li>a vessel towed or if more than one vessel is towed the last vessel of the tow, if manned, shall at intervals of not more than two minutes sound four blasts in succession, namely one prolonged followed by three short blasts. When practicable, this signal shall be made immediately after the signal made by the towing vessel.</li>
      <li>when a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit they shall be regarded as a power-driven vessel and shall give the signals prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Rule.</li>
      <li>a vessel at anchor shall at intervals of not more than one minute ring the bell rapidly for about five seconds. In a vessel of 100 metres or more in length the bell shall be sounded in the forepart of the vessel and immediately after the ringing of the bell the gong shall be sounded rapidly for about five seconds in the after part of the vessel. A vessel at anchor may in addition sound three blasts in succession, namely one short, one prolonged and one short blast, to give warning of her position and of the possibility of collision to an approaching vessel.</li>
      <li>a vessel aground shall give the bell signal and if required the gong signal prescribed in paragraph (g) of this Rule and shall, in addition, give three separate and distinct strokes on the bell immediately before and after the rapid ringing of the bell. A vessel aground may in addition sound an appropriate whistle signal.</li>
      <li>a vessel of 12 metres or more but less than 20 metres in length shall not be obliged to give the bell signals prescribed in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this Rule. However, if she does not, she shall make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more than 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>a vessel of less than 12 metres in length shall not be obliged to give the above mentioned signals but, if she does not, shall make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more than 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>a pilot vessel when engaged on pilotage duty may in addition to the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b) or (g) of this Rule sound an identity signal consisting of four short blasts.</li>
      Canadian modifications exist for this rule as follows...
      <li>notwithstanding paragraph (j), in the Canadian waters of a roadstead, harbour, river, lake or inland waterway, a vessel shall sound the signals prescribed for a vessel of 12 metres or more in length if it is<br>
      i. less than 12 metres in length,<br>
      ii. ordinarily used for the purpose of pushing or pulling any floating object, and<br>
      iii. not located within a recognized mooring, storage or booming area.</li>
     </ul>
     There are a lot of sound signals which are covered under this rule; more complex signals tend to build upon the most basic fog signal for power-driven vessels. As a general rule, no signal will ever sound at a frequency of more than 2 minutes, and each signal begins at least one prolonged blast (to differentiate, as all of the standard non-fishing manoeuvering signals begin with one short blast). There is another very distinct line drawn between vessels <i>underway and making way</i> and vessels <i>underway but not making way</i>, both of which are in reference to vessels which are not anchored, aground, or tied to the dock but are either making way (engine propulsion, wind pushing sails) or not (drifting through the water).
    </div>
    <div><b>(36) Signals to Attract Attention</b>:
     <ul>if necessary to attract the attention of another vessel any vessel may make light or sound signals that cannot be mistaken for any signal authorized elsewhere in these Rules, or may direct the beam of her searchlight in the direction of the danger, in such a way as not to embarrass any vessel. Any light to attract the attention of another vessel shall be such that it cannot be mistaken for any aid to navigation. For the purpose of this Rule the use of high intensity intermittant or revolving lights, such as strobe lights, shall be avoided.
     </ul>
    </div>
    <div><b>(37) Distress Signals</b>:
     <ul>when a vessel is in distress and requires assistance she shall use or exhibit the signals described in <a href="#distress" class="cite">Annex IV</a>.

    </div>
   </div><!-- end of sound and light signals-->
   
   <h3>Part E - Exemptions</h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div><b>(38) Exemptions</b>: 
     <ul>Any vessel (or class of vessels) provided that she complies with the requirements of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1960, the keel of which is laid or which is at a corresponding stage of construction before the entry into force of these Regulations is exempted from compliance therewith as follows:
      <li>the installation of lights with ranges prescribed in <a href="#22" class="cite">Rule 22</a>, until four years after the date of entry into force of these Regulations.</li>
      <li>the installation of lights with colour specifications as prescribed in section 7 of Annex I to these Regulations, until four years after the date of entry into force of these Regulations.</li>
      <li>the repositioning of lights as a result of conversion from Imperial to metric units and rounding off measurement figures, permanent exemption.</li>
      <li>i. the repositioning of masthead lights on vessels of less than 150 metres in length, resulting from the prescriptions of section 3(a) of Annex I, permanent exemption.<br>
      ii. the repositioning of masthead lights on vessels of 150 metres or more in length, resulting from the prescriptions of section 3(a) of Annex I, until nine years after the date of entry into force of these Regulations.</li>
      <li>the repositioning of masthead lights resulting from the prescriptions of section 2(b) of Annex I, until nine years after the date of entry into force of these Regulations.</li>
      <li>the repositioning of sidelights resulting from the prescriptions of sections 2(g) and 3(b) of Annex I, until nine years after the date of entry into force of these Regulations</li>
      <li>the requirements for sound signal appliances prescribed in Annex III, until nine years after the date of entry into force of these Regulations.</li>
      <li>the repositioning of all-round lights resulting from the prescription of section 9(b) of Annex I, permanent exemption.</li>
      Canadian modifications for this rule exist as follows...
      <li>for the purposes of paragraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g), the nine years referred to therein shall be considered to commence on July 15, 1977.</li>
      <li>notwithstanding paragraph (i), the nine years referred to in paragraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g) shall be considered to commence on March 1, 1983 for vessels exclusively engaged in inland voyages.</li>
     </ul>
    </div>
    <div>The following rules (39-46) are exclusive to the Canadian modifications to the COLREGS</div>
    <div><b>(39) Special Signals for Dangerous Goods</b>:
     <ul>In the Canadian waters of a roadstead, harbour, river, lake or inland waterway, a vessel that is taking in, discharging or carrying dangerous goods shall,
      <li>when not underway, exhibit where it can best be seen, an all-round red light <i>or</i> the International Code flag “B”; and</li>
      <li>when underway, exhibit where it can best be seen, the International Code flag “B” but not an all-round red light.</li>
     </ul>
     Very simple rule; a vessel carrying dangerous goods will always fly the red 'Bravo' flag, but only when <i>not underway</i> is able to exhibit an all around red light. Most vessels to which this rule applies will just always have their 'B' flag flown. It is important for the all-around red light, if exhibited, to not be displayed in a way in which it may be mistaken for another light, or falsely taken as part of a combination of other lights displayed.
    </div>
    <div id="40"><b>(40) Radar Reflectors</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>subject to paragraph (b), a vessel that is less than 20 metres in length or is constructed primarily of non-metallic materials shall, if practicable, be equipped with a radar reflector or other means to enable the vessel’s detection by other vessels navigating by radar at 3 GHz or 9 GHz.</li>
      <li>Paragraph (a) does not apply where<br>
      i. a vessel operates in limited traffic conditions, daylight, and favourable environmental conditions and where compliance is not essential for the safety of the vessel, or<br>
      ii. the small size of the vessel or its operation away from radar navigation makes compliance impracticable.</li>
      <li>the radar reflector or other means to enable detection prescribed in paragraph (a) shall, to the extent practicable, meet the requirements of<br>
      i. sections 3 to 5 of the Annex to Resolution A.384(X), made by the Organization and as amended from time to time, if fitted before July 1, 2005,<br>
      ii. sections 3 to 5 of the Annex to Resolution MSC.164(78), made by the Organization and as amended from time to time, if fitted on or after July 1, 2005, or<br>
      iii. other performance standards that the Minister determines provide a level of safety that is equivalent to or higher than that of those standards.</li>
      <li>for the purpose of interpreting a document incorporated by reference into this Rule, “should” shall be read to mean “shall” and recommendations shall be mandatory.</li>
     </ul>
     The key part to this section is the mention of either a vessel which is <i>less than</i> 20 meters in length (constructed with any materials) or is constructed with non-metallic materials (wood). The radar reflector should not be painted black so as to avoid confusion with any day shape. There are two kinds of radar reflectors; 'active' and 'passive', of which 'active' transponders are electronic and enhance the signal they recieve before reflecting it; whereas 'passive' reflectors just reflect back the radar wave.
    </div>
    <div><b>(41) Transponders</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>no vessel, except a vessel in distress, shall use a transponder that can transmit radar responder signals or radar beacon signals in the 3- or 10-centimetre marine radar bands.</li>
      <li>notwithstanding paragraph (a), an exploration or exploitation vessel may use such a transponder if authorized to do so under this Rule and the transponder is used in a manner that does not compromise the safety of navigation.</li>
      <li>the Minister shall authorize the use of a transponder if it will be used in a manner that will not interfere with or degrade the use of radar in navigation, having regard to factors such as<br>
      i. the proximity of other transponders and the distinctiveness of their signals,<br>
      ii. the frequency, range and power of the transponder, and<br>
      iii. the marine radar band to be used.</li>
     </ul>
     Use of the SART is an internationally recognized signal for distress, and will only respond to a 3cm (X-band) radar. If the use of radar transponders was not subject to regulation and control then it is concievable that when navigating in areas of high traffic, there may be numerous transponder beacons which would crowd the radar screens and interfere with navigation.
    </div>
    <div><b>(42) Additional Requirements for Exploration or Exploitation Vessels</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>an exploration or exploitation vessel shall display identification panels bearing the name, identification letters or numerals of the vessel so that at least one panel is visible in any direction.</li>
      <li>the name, identification letters or numerals referred to in paragraph (a) shall be<br>
      i. black,<br>
      ii. not less than one meter in height,<br>
      iii. displayed on a yellow background, and,<br>
      iv. easily visible in daylight and at night by the use of illumination or retro-reflecting material.</li>
      <li>subject to paragraph (h), an exploration or exploitation vessel, when stationary and engaged in drilling or production operations, shall, in lieu of the lights or shapes required by these Rules, exhibit where it can best be seen from any direction a white light or a series of white lights located at an equal height above the water and operating in unison, which light or lights shall<br>
      i. flash the morse letter “U” at intervals of not more than 15 seconds,<br>
      ii. be installed at a height above the water of not less than six metres and not more than 30 metres so that at least one light shall remain visible to within 15 metres of the vessel,<br>
      iii. be visible all round the horizon at a nominal range of 15 miles,<br>
      iv. be powered by a reliable power source,<br>
      v. be equipped with an auxiliary power source, and<br>
      vi. be exhibited from 15 minutes before sunset until sunrise and at all times when the visibility in any direction is two miles or less.</li>
      <li>the horizontal and vertical extremities of an exploration or exploitation vessel that is stationary and engaged in drilling or production operations shall be adequately marked in compliance with the requirements set out in Transport Canada Standards Obstruction Markings (2nd ed.), 1987, TP 382, as amended from time to time</li>
      <li>An exploration or exploitation vessel, when stationary and engaged in drilling or production operations, shall be equipped with a sound-signalling appliance that<br>
      i. is powered by a reliable power source,<br>
      ii. is provided with an auxiliary power source,<br>
      iii. when operating, emits a rhythmic blast corresponding to the Morse letter “U” every 30 seconds,<br>
      iv. has its maximum intensity at a frequency between 100 and 1 000 Hertz,<br>
      v. has a usual range of at least two miles,<br>

      vii. is so placed that the sound emitted is audible, when there is no wind, throughout the required range in all directions in a horizontal plane from the vessel.</li>
      <li>an exploration or exploitation vessel, when stationary and engaged in drilling or production operations, shall, whenever the visibility in any direction is two miles or less, operate the sound-signalling appliance described in paragraph (e) in lieu of the sound signal described in Rule 35.</li>
      <li>an exploration or exploitation vessel shall comply with the relevant technical requirements set out in sections 2.3 and 2.4 of, and Appendix 1 to, the IALA’s publication Recommendations for the marking of offshore structures, as amended from time to time, and the nominal range of lights shall be computed in accordance with Appendix II of the IALA’s 1967 publication Recommendations for the notation of luminous intensity and range of lights.</li>
      <li>for the purposes of this Rule, wherever the word “Authority” appears in a document incorporated by reference, it shall be read as “Minister”.</li>
      <li>in the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes Basin, the white light or series of white lights exhibited by an exploration or exploitation vessel when stationary and engaged in drilling or production operations shall have a range of visibility of between eight and fifteen miles.</li>

    <div><b>(43) Safety Zones Around Exploration or Exploitation Vessels</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>for the purpose of this Rule, with respect to an exploration or exploitation vessel that is in position for the purpose of exploring or exploiting the non-living natural resources of the sea bed, a safety zone is the area that extends from the outer extremities of the exploration or exploitation vessel to the greater of<br>
      i. 500 metres in all directions, and<br>
      ii. 50 metres beyond the boundaries of the anchor pattern of the vessel.</li>
      <li>the Minister may establish a safety zone greater than the safety zone referred to in paragraph (a) if it is reasonably related to the nature and function of the exploration or exploitation vessel and is necessary to ensure navigational safety.</li>
      <li>no vessel shall navigate within a safety zone.</li>
      <li>Paragraph (c) does not apply to a vessel that<br>
      i. is in distress,<br>
      ii. is attempting to save life or provide assistance to a vessel in distress,<br>
      iii. is operated by or on behalf of the state having jurisdiction over the exploration or exploitation operations, or<br>
      iv. has received permission from the person in charge of the exploration or exploitation vessel to enter the safety zone around that vessel.</li>
     </ul>
     This rule is largely in reference to offshore drilling and operations surrounding offshore exploitation work. The minimum safety zone around an exploitation vessel is either 500 meters, or 50 meters beyond the anchor pattern of the vessel (a circular radius around the vessel), whichever is the larger value
    </div>
    <div><b>(44) Ocean Data Acquisition Systems (ODAS)</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>Every Canadian ODAS shall clearly display its identification number on an exterior surface where it can be clearly seen and, if practicable, shall display the name and address of the owner of the ODAS.</li>
      <li>Subject to paragraph (f), every ODAS shall be constructed or fitted with a radar reflector, or other means, that has a radar response that at least meets the requirements set out in <a href="#40" class="cite">Rule 40</a>.</li>
      <li>Every ODAS that is designed to operate while floating with part of its structure extending above the water shall<br>
      i. be coloured yellow,<br>
      ii. have a shape that cannot be confused with the shape of a navigational mark, and<br>
      iii. where technically practicable,<br>
      A) have a topmark consisting of a yellow “X” shape,<br>
      B) exhibit a yellow light visible at a minimum range of five miles that gives a group of five flashes every 20 seconds, and<br>
      C) be equipped with an appliance that emits a sound signal at intervals of not more than two minutes, which sound signal cannot be confused with any other signal prescribed by these Rules or with the sound signal of any aid to navigation in the vicinity of the ODAS.</li>
      <li>Subject to paragraph (f), every ODAS designed to operate under water, other than an ODAS referred to in paragraph (e), shall<br>
      i. be escorted by a surface vessel that gives warning of the presence of the ODAS in accordance with <a href="#27" class="cite">Rule 27</a>, or<br>
      ii. have tethered to it a surface float that is marked, provides the radar response, is lighted and sounds the signals specified in paragraphs (a) to (c).</li>
      <li>Every ODAS designed to operate when resting on the bottom of a sea, lake or river with part of its structure extending above the water shall be marked, exhibit lights and shapes, and sound signals in the same manner as an exploration or exploitation vessel.</li>
      <li>Paragraphs (b) and (d) do not apply to an ODAS where<br>
      i. the Minister has determined that the ODAS does not constitute a potential danger to navigation by reason of<br>
      A) its size, material, construction, area or method of operation,<br>
      B) the nature and condition of the waters in the area of operation of the ODAS, and<br>
      C) the use that is or might reasonably be expected to be made of those waters, and<br>
      ii. the Minister has given the owner of the ODAS notice in writing of that determination.</li>

    <div><b>(45) Blue Flashing Light</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>Any government vessel or any vessel that is owned or operated by a harbour, river, county or municipal police force may exhibit as an identification signal a blue flashing light when the vessel<br>
      i. is providing assistance in any waters to any vessel or other craft, aircraft or person that is threatened by grave and imminent danger and requires immediate assistance, or<br>
      ii. is engaged in law enforcement duties in Canadian waters.</li>
      <li>Any vessel operated by the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary may exhibit a blue flashing light as an identification signal when the vessel participates, at the request of the Canadian Coast Guard, in search and rescue operations.</li>
      <li>A vessel referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) that exhibits a blue flashing light as an identification signal is not relieved from the obligation to comply with the Steering and Sailing Rules set out in Part B.</li>
     </ul>
     Blue flashing lights, which are not used internationally and exist within the Canadian modifications to the colregs, are always associated with the police and government vessels. No other vessels use blue lights or are permitted the use of blue lights.
    </div>
    <div><b>(46) Alternate System of Navigation Lights</b>:
     <ul>
      <li>For the purpose of this Rule, “alternate system of navigation lights” means a backup system that includes masthead lights, sidelights, a sternlight and the lights prescribed in Rule 30 for vessels at anchor.</li>
      <li>This Rule does not apply to<br>
      i. vessels that are less than 15 metres in length,<br>
      ii. cable ferries, or<br>
      iii. pleasure craft.</li>
      <li>A Canadian vessel required by Part C to exhibit lights shall be fitted with an alternate system of navigation lights.</li>
      <li>In the case of vessels built before January 1, 1991, that have a gross tonnage of less than 500, the alternate system of navigation lights may consist of oil or electronic lanterns.</li>
      <li>If it is impracticable for a vessel or object being towed or pushed to comply with paragraph (c), spare lights shall be readily available so that the vessel or object maintains compliance with Part C.</li>
      <li>The alternate system of navigation lights shall be supplied by the main source of electric power and the emergency source of electric power that are referred to in section 15 of Annex I, unless otherwise provided by paragraph (g).</li>
      <li>In the case of vessels built before January 1, 1991, having a gross tonnage of less than 500, the alternate system of navigation lights shall be supplied by<br>
      i. the vessel’s emergency source of electric power, or<br>
      ii. in the case of oil or electronic lanterns, power of a capacity sufficient for the duration of the intended voyage.</li>
      <li>Lights using a flame shall not be used as the alternate system of navigation lights on any vessel carrying, towing or pushing cargo that is volatile or explosive.</li>
     </ul>
     Of note with this rule is that it does not apply to vessels less than 15 meters in length (0m-14.999m), pleasurecraft, or cable ferries. This rule is in reference to the carriage of backup lights to assure compliance with the rules regarding the display of lights onboard. 46h mentions that flames are not to be used in the event, as they can easily give the wrong impression and be interpreted as a signal for distress (among other things). The key year to remember here is 1991, which determines whether a vessel may be allowed to have non-electric lights.

    <h3>ANNEX IV - Distress Signals</h3>
    <div id="distress"><b>(A4) Distress Signals</b>:
     <ul>1. The following signals, used or exhibited either together or separately, indicate distress and need of assistance:
      <li>a gun or other explosive signals fired at intervals of about a minute;</li>
      <li>a continuous sounding with any fog-signalling apparatus;</li>
      <li>rockets or shells, throwing red stars fired one at a time at short intervals;</li>
      <li>a signal made by any signalling method consisting of the group …---… (SOS) in the Morse Code;</li>
      <li>a signal sent by radiotelephony consisting of the spoken word “MAYDAY”;</li>
      <li>the International Code Signal of distress indicated by N.C.;</li>
      <li>a signal consisting of a square flag having above or below it a ball or anything resembling a ball;</li>
      <li>flames on the vessel (as from a burning tar barrel, oil barrel, etc.);</li>
      <li>a rocket parachute flare or a hand-flare showing a red light;</li>
      <li>a smoke signal giving off orange-coloured smoke;</li>
      <li>slowly and repeatedly raising and lowering arms outstretched to each side;</li>
      <li>a distress alert by means of digital selective calling (DSC) transmitted on<br>
      i. VHF channel 70,<br>
      ii. MF/HF on the frequencies 2 187.5 kHz, 8 414.5 kHz, 4 207.5 kHz, 6 312 kHz, 12 577 kHz or 16 804.5 kHz; (US only)</li>
      <li>a ship-to-shore distress alert transmitted by the ship’s Inmarsat or other mobile satellite service provider ship earth station;</li>
      <li>signals transmitted by emergency position-indicating radio beacons;</li>
      <li>approved signals transmitted by radiocommunications systems, including survival craft radar transponders.</li>
      2. The use or exhibition of any of the foregoing signals, except for the purpose of indicating distress and need of assistance and the use of other signals which may be confused with any of the above signals, is prohibited.
     </ul>
     <ul>3.Attention is drawn to the relevant sections of the International Code of Signals, the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual, Volume III, and the following signals:
      <li>a piece of orange-coloured canvas with either a black square and circle or other appropriate symbol (for identification from the air); and</li>
      <li>a dye marker.</li>
     </ul>
     Canadian Modifications
     <ul>4. In Canadian waters or fishing zones, in addition to the signals described in section 1, the following signals may be used or exhibited either together or separately to indicate distress and need of assistance:
      <li>a square shape or anything resembling a square shape; and</li>
      <li>a high intensity white light flashing at regular intervals of 50 to 70 times per minute.</li>
      5 Notwithstanding section 2 and paragraph 4(b), a North Cardinal Buoy may use a quick flashing white light flashing at regular intervals of 60 times per minute.
     </ul>
     <ul>6. Section 3 of this Annex shall be read as follows: “The signals in the International Code of Signals and the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual, Volume III, shall be used as the circumstances require to supplement the signals described in section 1 of this Annex. The following signals are in addition to the signals described in section 1:
      <li>a piece of orange-coloured canvas with either a black square and circle or other appropriate symbol (for identification from the air); and</li>
      <li>a dye marker.”</li>
     </ul>
     On this list, there are 17 signals for distress, which can be considered as international signals and must be memorized, as it reflects extremely poorly on an examination applicant to fail any questions related to distress signalling. A4.1d references the widely known morse code 'SOS' for distress, though it should also be considered that seeing the more for the inverse code, OSO (---...---) could also be an indicator of distress for inexperienced or unfamiliar persons who get the prescribed morse code backwards. With flares, the presence of <i>red</i> stars or the color red are associated with distress, as there are other scenarios where different colored flares may be used to convey a different meaning. A4.1l mentions the transmission of a DSC alert over the radio, though it is worth noting that Canada does not have support for MF/HF radio across the country at all radio stations, because VHF is what is most widely used here. A4.2b regarding dye markers makes no reference to specific color, so the presence of any dye marker in the water is an indication of distress. With the canadian modifications to the annex, there is the addition of two more distress signals (and the mention that one signal is similar to the light characteristic of a north cardinal buoy) and the provision in A4.6 regarding rules in A4.3 which are to be taken as supplementary signals with signals from A4.1. Annex 4 is amended often, and was amended as recently as 2023 (though not majorly) and so it is prudent to refresh on this section of the rules often.

   <h3>STCW and SOLAS</h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div><b>Principals to be Observed by the OOW</b>: <br><br>
     The OOW is a qualified professional who is the representative of the Master, and is responsible primarily for ensuring the safe navigation of the vessel. The OOW is to be qualified, capable and should not hesitate to execute any action which will best ensure the safety of the crew, vessel, and the marine environment. When a ship is at sea, the OOW has a lot of responsibility onboard. Competence of navigation and of seamanship is based upon the knowledge in principles and rules, experience at sea, and proficiency in carrying duties out diligently. In a broad perspective, the goal of every mariner should be the safety of life at sea, protection of the marine environment, and the protection of property.
     <ul class="mt">
      <li>WATCHKEEPING: it is the duty of the OOW to maintain lookout. perform routine equipment checks, maintain general surveillance of the ship and shipboard activities, record bridge activities and navigational procedueres, and to comply with the rules for collision avoidance at all times. </li>
      <li>NAVIGATION: to excecute and monitor the course of the voyage as set out in the passage plan, to ensure that the voyage is proceeding in accordance with the general passage plan. Part of this task is performing frequent position fixes using multiple means (ie. not relying only on gps or radar to give position due to the presence of equipment errors), and no specific timeframe for routine checks is given it may vary depending on proximity to hazards or whether operating in coastal waters. Part of these checks is to fix the position of the vessel, but it is also important that the course steered is verified in the event that there are any compass errors. The OOW should make effective use of all systems which are at their disposal (ie. if the vessel is equipped with two different radars, use both of them even if one is 'sufficient' for the task).</li>
      <li>RADIO COMMUNICATIONS: during distress incidents, one of the qualified radio operators onboard should be designated to have primary responsibility for radio communcations. If on a passenger vessel, this person should be given the sole duty of managing radio communcations due to the variety of factors which must be managed onboard a passenger vessel and that may distract from the responsibility of maintaining radio communcations.</li>
      <li>KNOWLEDGE OF VESSEL: the OOW should be aware of the vessels manoeuvring characteristics including rate of turn, stopping distance, cargo, and any other factor which will otherwise affect or impact the maneouvrability of the vessel, particularily in regards to collision avoidance.</li>
      <li>SAFETY SYSTEMS: the OOW should not hesitate to make use of engine controls or sound signals at any time. It is important that the OOW is both familiar with the location of safety equipment on the bridge and of its operation. Routine checks of safety equipment shall be conducted to ensure functionality. </li>
      <li>POLLUTION PREVENTION: in the event of a pollution incident, it is important that the OOW is familiar with any regulations (MARPOL) and procedures which factor into a marine pollution incident. In the event that a pollution incident occurs, the OOW should know how to report such an incident, and it should be logged within the ships logbook as well. It is important to pay due caution to risk of pollution, and precautions to protect the marine environment should always be taken. </li>
      <li>SAFETY INCIDENTS: the OOW should know the location of safety equipment onboard, how to use it, and the procedures for reporting and handling emergency, distress, and general safety situations onboard. In the event of any safety incident onboard, it is advisable to immediately inform the Master of such incidents, particularily if in accordance with any standing orders issued by the Master.</li>
      <li>RECORDKEEPING: proper records should be kept in regards to shipboard procedures, in compliance with governing acts and regulations, and relating to the navigation of a vessel. Even with the introduction of systems like the Voyage Data Recorder, which most often stores the voyage trackline data, there is still a need to maintain the ships logbook. Any change of the OOW must be logged, as well as any equipment deficiencies, routine drills, and checks performed in accordance with the ISM code.</li>
     </ul>
    </div>
    <div><b>Bridge Teamwork Procedures</b>: 
     <ul class="mt">
      <li>RELIEF OF WATCHKEEPERS: under no circumstance should the presence of the Master or another qualified individual on the bridge relieve the OOW of their responsibilities. The OOW may only pass on the watch when their relief has been fully briefed on all factors which include; environmental, manoeuverability, equipment defects, traffic, system of steering (manual or automatic), their eyes are adjusted to darkness (in night watch), and they are fit and capable (they are not drunk, high, fatigued, or any subject to any other impairing/inhibiting factors). For an OOW who is taking over the watch, these factors also apply; it is important that all members of the bridge team are not impaired by any means and are aware of the circumstances surrounding the navigation of the vessel. Relief should never take place in the middle of a course alteration or navigational procedure, and should be deferred until after the manoeuvre is complete. </li>
      <li>ASSIGNMENT OF DUTIES: the OOW should never be assigned or undertake a duty which interferes with the safe navigation of the vessel. There may be times when it is acceptable for the OOW to perform lookout duties, but in most scenarios it is most prudent to have a second person qualified to perform lookout, who performs that sole duty in the wheelhouse and frees the OOW to perform other navigational tasks. It is almost always unnacceptable for the OOW to perform manual steering activities, because when acting as quartermaster they are unable to leave that posting without leaving it unattended. In situations like restricted visibility, it is prudent to have extra bodies in the bridge in order to perform any extra duties as required.</li>
      <li>INFORMING THE ENGINE ROOM: depending on the circumstances surrounding naviagtion, there may be perimeters placed regarding operation of the engine or other mechanical systems onboard which require advance notice. Certain ships may have an unmanned engine room (called an E/0 or UMS for Unmanned Machinery Space) where engine personnel are not physically in the engineroom but are available at all times over the radio as required. Whenever possible, advance notice should be given before operating major mechanical systems (ie. informing the engineroom when the stabilizers are to be deployed, requesting the thruster propulsion systems from the engine room, etc.).</li>
     </ul>
    </div>
    <div><b>Procedures Observed with a Pilot Onboard</b>:
     <ul class="mt">
      <li>Except in the Panama Canal with the Panama pilots, at no time does the presence of a pilot in the bridge relieve the OOW or master of their duty to safely navigate the vessel.</li>
      <li>Even if the pilot is a highly qualified individual, it is ultimately the responsibility of the OOW to safely navigate the vessel and the pilot is an advisory role. The actions of the pilot should be carefully scrutinized, just the same as the actions of any individual navigating the ship should be weighed.</li>
     </ul>
    </div>
    <div><b>When to inform the Master</b>: <br><br>
     The master is to be informed when any situation is encountered where the OOW is in doubt or unsure of how to proceed. The master is also to be informed when....
     <ul class="mt">
      <li>- entering an area of restricted visibility</li>
      <li>- when entering an area with heavy traffic (no number is given, it is up to the OOW's judgement)</li>
      <li>- there is difficulty maintaining on course</li>
      <li>- at the failure to sight land or any navigational aid when it is expected to see them</li>
      <li>- when unexpectedly sighting land or any navigational aids</li>
      <li>- there is a mechanical failure onboard, or any sort of breakdown of machinery</li>
      <li>- the radio is malfunctioning</li>
      <li>- in heavy weather, or if in doubt that any weather may cause damage to the vessel</li>
      <li>- the vessel encounteres any hazard to navigation</li>
      <li>- in any emergency</li>
      <li>- in accordance with any standing orders issued by the Master</li>
     </ul>
     It is also worth note that while the master should be immediately informed in these circumstances, any action to avoid collision shall be taken first because it is the utmost priority to take avoiding action and ensure the safe operation of the vessel. The OOW should never hesitate to take action that ensures the safe navigation of the vessel.
    </div>
    <div><b>Checks Surrounding Steerage and Steering Systems</b>: 
     <ul class="mt">
      <li>MANUAL STEERING: It is not acceptable to use the autopilot when navigating in dense traffic, close proximity to hazards, and when in restricted visibility; in these scenarios, manual steering is used. The acting quartermaster or helmsman is not the same position as the lookout (carrying out helm orders distracts from the duties of the lookout as set out in <a href="#5" class="cite">rule 5</a> of the colregs). When operating on autopilot for an extended period of time, the functionality of the manual steering system must be checked regularily and at a minimum frequency of <i>at least once a watch</i>. In the event that manual steering is anticipated, extra qualified personnel should be called to the bridge to fufil this role so as to not distract from other duties which must be performed by the bridge team.</li>
      <li><a href="#autopilot" class="cite">AUTOPILOT</a>: it must be possible to switch from automatic to manual steering 'immediately' which means that the switch over must be executable within <i>3 seconds</i>. The changeover from manual to automatic steering must be observed by the OOW. The automatic pilot should also have its functionality routinely tested to ensure that it is working correctly. </li>
      <li><a href="#equipment" class="cite">COMPASSES</a>: both the gyro and magnetic compasses shall be checked at a frequency of at least <i>once per watch</i>. The compass systems onboard are integral to the steering systems and are linked to many other navigational systems onboard.</li>
      <li>STEERING GEAR: <i>within 12 hours before departure</i> the operation of the steering gear and steerage systems onboard must be checked. Part of these routine checks are tests to the main and auxiliary methods for steering, the remote control and remote control alarms for these systems, the emergency power supply, and the level of hydraulic fluid in the steering pumps should be checked. These checks are typically performed in conjunction with checks done by the engine room. The angle of the actual rudders position should be checked against the position indicated by the rudder angle indicators. These checks also include full movement of the rudder from hard-over to hard-over, visual inspection of the gear itself, tests of the communication systems linked to the steering gear, and observance that simple instructions for operation are posted at the station and in the bridge. Routine emergency steering drills are to be conducted at a minimum frequency of <i>every 3 months.</i></li>
     </ul>
    </div>
    <div><b>Navigation in Coastal Waters</b>:
     <ul>When navigating in coastal waters it is important that the largest scale chart which is appropriate for use is being used, that the radar range used is appropriate and no information is obscured or omitted as a result of the scale in use, and that the collision regulations are being complied with.</ul>
    </div>
    <div><b>STCW and ISM Code</b>:
     <ul class="mt">
      <li>FAMILIARIZATION: There is a general obligation under both ISM and STCW for ships personnel to recieve ship specific familiarization in safety matters. It is prudent for a ships crewmember, when first joining a vessel, to read the Vessel Specific Manual to aid with familiarization of ship-specific practices and sytems.</li>
      <li>HOURS OF REST: fatigue is a major inhibiting factor in safety and mandatory hours of rest have been set in the STCW code to ensure that rest is being taken. In a 24 hour period, there must be allowed a rest period of <i>at least 10 hours</i>. If this rest period is taken in two seperate periods, then at least one of those periods must be a <i>minimum of 6 hours</i>. The minimum period of 10 hours rest may be reduced to not less than 6 hours provided that any such reduction does not extend beyond two days, and not less than 70 hours are provided each 7 day period.</li>
      <li>ALCOHOL: the maximum permitted blood alcohol level is <i>0.05%</i> and alcohol must not be consumed <i>within 4 hours of coming on watch</i>.</li>
     </ul>
     Hours of rest is a question that comes up frequently both in the navigation safety examinations and in the general seamanship oral examinations.
    </div>
   </div>
   
   <h3>Review of Content</h3>
   <div class="indent info">
    <div>The navigation safety examination encompasses not just the collision regulations- it also includes content from the STCW code (1995/2010) and <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2020-216/">Navigation Safety Regulations</a> (2020). After doing a few practice exams I have found that the 100-question examination consists of around 90 questions that cover anything in the collision regulations, including the annexes and prefaces to the content (the applications, proof of compliance,etc.), and about 10 which cover the STCW code. The content about STCW is straightforward for the most part and I tend to regard it as at least 8 or 9 'free' points on the exam so long as the candidate is aware of frequencies at which certain equipment is tested and drills are conducted. With the collision regulations, the content can be divided between any section- though typically, around 10 questions or so will focus on rather esoteric content from the annexes and special canadian exemptions. What I find most difficult are the differences in the annexes between the angular, vertical, and horizontal seperation of lights, between the international and canadian provisions, which naturally could not just be simple and have largely the same measurements. To accomodate for this content, because I know that I cannot memorize the 20-section annex by heart on top of all the other content I have to memorize- I think that it is a wise decision to double down on the 'meat' of the colregs (Parts B, C, and D) in order to better improve the odds of getting those questions correct on the exam. In regards to lights, particular care should be had in memorizing the visible ranges of lights for vessels of particular sizes (especially the all-around lights) and of which vessels display different lights if they are <i>making way through the water</i> as opposed to simply being underway. Good examples of this are vessels not under command (which through extraordinary means are not able to maneouvre as required by the rules), which only when actually making way through the water will display sidelights and a sternlight; whereas vessels restricted in their ability to maneouvre (by the nature of their work), when <i>making way through the water</i>, will display sidelights, a sternlight, <i>and</i> a masthead light. Also of note are cases where specific types of vessels will keep their 'special' lights on even at anchor, like vessels engaged in fishing or vessels restricted in their ability to maneouvre. On the note of vessels engaged in fishing- this definition only encompasses vessels which have limited manoeuvrability as a result of the fishing apparatus they drag through the water (trawlers/draggers, seiners, gillnetters)- which does NOT include trollers (outside of the canadian modification to <a href="#10" class="cite">Rule 10</a>, section Q), as their gear does not impact their manoeuvrability. It is advisable to be very familiar with <a href="#2" class="cite">rules 2</a>(arguably the most important rule), <a href="#5" class="cite">5</a> and <a href="#6" class="cite">6</a> (also of great importance), and <a href="#19" class="cite">rule 19</a>; with particular note towards Part B section III (not in sight) situations which evolve into section II (in sight) situations. An area of personal weakness is collision avoidance in crossing scenarios with vessels that are not power driven vessels, and divert to the heirarchy of <a href="#18" class="cite">rule 18</a> and action to be taken differs from action normally prescribed in that scenario. Generally, overtaking vessels will always be required to give way- but it may not intially be apparent that a described situation is an overtaking situation. Even in cases where 'occasionally' the sidelights or mastlights are seen by a vessel abaft the beam, they may still in acutality be an overtaking vessel because of the small degree of leeway in angular perceptions of the lights (as prescribed in Annex I). There are also cases between two power-driven vessels in scenarios where action is prescribed- but where taking prescribed action would result in endangering the give way vessel and non-traditional action must be taken (such as in the case of a give-way vessel with current pushing towards a navigational hazard to starboard that finds itself in a crossing scenario- the give way vessel cannot endanger themself and must, even if it is cautioned against and may confuse the stand-on vessel, must alter to port rather than decrease their speed. In this scenario, even if this manoeuvre results in the stand on vessel needing to take avoiding action, this is the correct answer). The last bit of content worth mentioning are sound signals, which when prescribed for manoeuvring are to be used <i>only in sight of other vessels</i>, so when they appear in questions about alterations of course in restricted visibility, <a href="#34" class="cite">Rule 34</a> does not actually apply unless the vessel being avoided has been visually sighted. When analyzing exam questions, it is extremely important to dissect them down into their relevant sections (vessel type, making way or not, in sight or not, the range between vessels, and for canadians whether the question is modified for canada or international).
