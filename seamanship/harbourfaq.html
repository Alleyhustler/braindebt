  <h4>What do I do at work?</h4>
  <div class="indent">I am a deckhand on a 500ft commercial passenger ferry. I work 2 week watches/shifts and live onboard the ship during that time. Deckhands have a really wide variety of general tasks they perform onboard, so I kind of just do various small jobs like keeping lookout (mostly for whales and big logs), loading traffic and inspecting equipment.</div>
  
  <h4>How did you get into this line of work?</h4>
  <div class="indent">
   I took a 6-week course on seamanship in university and 2 marine emergency duty (MEDs) courses to become qualified. I didn't really know much about ships at that time and also didn't grow up on the coast where I could see them; but it ended up being a perfect fit for me.
  </div>
  
  <h4>What is your favorite kind of ship?</h4>
  <div class="indent">I love any large ship, but my favorite type is probably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy-lift_ship">semi-submersible heavy-lift vessel</a>. This kind of ship is really cool- they are engineered with decks low to the waterline and are designed to be ballasted down into the water, 'submerging' most of the ship and allowing heavy/large cargo to be floated onto the deck. These are the kinds of boats that tow massive factory equipment, offshore installations, and other ships around the world.
  </div>
